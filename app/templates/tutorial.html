<div class="container">
  <h3 id="prepare">1. Prepare your Dataset</h3>
  <p>First, you will need to prepare your data. To upload a dataset,
  you will need a zip file of your documents. The dashboard assumes
  the zip file will contain a hierarchy of folders. For example, you
  might have collected news articles from three regions: Mexico, US,
  and the "Northern Triangle". So at the "top" level you would have
  three folders: Mexico, US, and NT (for Northern Triangle). But let's
  say you also grouped the articles by the time period they were
  published. So within each of the region folders, you also have
  folders 'phase 1', 'phase 2', and so on, as shown in the figure
  below.
  </p>

  <figure class="figure d-block text-center"> 
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/example-hierarchy.png') }}"
	 class="figure-img img-fluid"
	 alt="Example folder hierarchy. Top level: Mexico, NT, US. Bottom level: phases 1-4.">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">An example folder hierarchy</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Within each of these time period folders you would put your files
    containing the news articles.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <h4 class="alert-heading">Supported File Types</h4>
    <p>Currently this dashboard supports <strong>plain text</strong> files and <strong>Excel
	(.xlsx)</strong> files.</p>

    <p>The simplest case is plain text files that contain a single
    article each. However, articles retrieved from a database or via a
    script may produce files that contain many articles. Such files
    are supported IF the articles are separated by a consistent
    pattern (see "Wrangling" below). All files should use the same
    pattern to separate articles (or all files should contain a single
    article).</p>


    <p>Excel files should contain worksheets with a column in the 'A'
      row that starts with "Text". Each cell below that will be read
      as a separate article.Note: Older Excel files (.xls) are not
      supported.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Finally, you need to put this hierarchy into a zip file. At the
  top level (in the example, this would be the folder containing the
  Mexico, US, and NT folders), select your folders. In Windows, you
  can then right-click and select "Send to", then "Compressed (zipped)
  folder" as shown below.</p>

  <figure class="figure d-block text-center"> 
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/send-to-zip.png') }}"
	 class="figure-img img-fluid"
	 alt="Zipping up the contents of a folder hierarchy.">

  </figure>


  <h3 id="upload">2. Upload your Dataset</h3>

  <p>In the <a href="{{ url_for('main.upload') }}"><em>Upload</em></a> page of
  the dashboard, enter a name for your dataset, select your zip file,
  and click "Upload".</p>

  <h3 id="wrangle">3. "Wrangle" your Dataset</h3>

  <p>Now we need to do some initial processing on the dataset. After
  uploading, you should automatically be taken to the <em>Wrangle</em> page of
  the dashboard (if not, you can get there using the top navigation
  bar).</p>

  <p>The most important item on this page is telling the dashboard
  whether or not the plain text files contain a single article or
  multiple, and if multiple, which pattern can be used to split up the
    articles. Ideally a simple pattern can be used, such as:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>--- split here! ---</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
      <h4 class="alert-heading">More Complicated Patterns</h4>
      <p>If you retrieved your articles from a database such as
      Factiva, you may need to use a more complicated pattern to split
	the articles. For example, articles may be separated by something like

	<blockquote>
	  <pre>Document j000000020010831dx8v0002g</pre>
	</blockquote>

	except that the numbers and letters after 'Document' may
	differ in each use. To match such a pattern you would need to
	use
	a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular
	expression</a> and click the "Use Regular Expression?"
	checkbox. This example can be matched with

	<blockquote>
	  <pre>^Document \w+$</pre>
	</blockquote>

	with the following meaning:

	<div class="alert alert-dark"><dl>
	  <dt>^</dt>
	  <dd>This is a special symbol in regular expressions meaning
	  match the start of a line. In other words, the rest of the
	  pattern ONLY applies if it appears at the beginning of a
	  line.</dd>
	  <dt>Document&blank;</dt>
	  <dd>This just literally means match "Document ". (Note the space after the word!)</dd>
	  <dt>\w</dt>
	  <dd>This special sequence means match any word character: a
	    letter, number, or underscore.</dd>
	  <dt>+</dt>
	  <dd>This is a special symbol in regular expressions meaning
	  match the previous item (in this case, a word character) one
	  or more times. Taken with the previous item, this means we
	  have to have at least one word character but could have
	    many, but nothing else (e.g., no spaces).</dd>
	  <dt>$</dt>
	  <dd>This is a special symbol in regular expressions meaning
	    the end of a line. This means that nothing else can appear
	    on the line after the previous items, or else there will not
	    be a match.</dd>
	  </dl></div>
      </p>

      <p>That may be enough for many uses, but for more complicated uses you can try <a href="https://regexone.com/">an interactive tutorial</a>.</p>

      <p>Regular expression can also be used during the 'explore' phase, below.</p>
											
    </div> <!-- alert (regular expressions) -->

    <p>The <em>Wrangle</em> page will also allow you to set names for the
    different 'levels' of your folder hierarchy. This is just for
    convenience; it provides more intuitive labels for some of the
      tables and charts.</p>

    <p>The page also provides a few statistics and informational items
    about what the software was able to read from your data.</p>

  <h3 id="explore">4. Explore your Dataset</h3>

  <p>Now you are ready to explore the dataset. After wrangling, you
  should automatically be taken to the <em>Explore</em> page of the dashboard
    (if not, you can get there using the top navigation bar).</p>

  <p>The <em>Settings</em> tab provides the details the software needs
    to process and analyze the data.

    <dl>
      <dt>Unit of Analysis</dt>
      <dd><p>Often analyzing full articles is not effective, since an
      article can discuss several topics of interest. Hence, this item
      allows you to break up articles into smaller 'chunks' for
	  analysis.</p>

	<p><em>Articles</em>, <em>Sentences</em>,
	  and <em>Paragraphs</em> should be self-explanatory.

	  <em>Fixed-sized windows</em> split each article into chunks
	  containing a fixed number (5) of sentences (except the chunk
	  at the end of an article, which have fewer sentences).

	  <em>Overlapping Contexts</em> searches for one of the filter
	  terms, and, when found, yields a chunk containing that
	  sentence, the two previous sentences, and the two following
	  sentences. Two chunks produced with this method may share
	  some sentences if filter terms appear close to each other,
	  which may or may not be a problem for the analysis.
	  
	  <em>Non-overlapping Contexts</em> is the same
	  as <em>Overlapping Contents</em> except that chunks are
	  guaranteed not to overlap. This may cause some chunks to
	  have fewer context sentences before a filter term, since
	  those sentences would be included only with the previous
	  chunk.
	  
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-danger">
	  <h5 class="alert-heading">Caution</h5>
	  <p>Splitting text into paragraphs and sentences is
	  approximate. Paragraphs may not be correctly detected if
	  subsequence paragraphs appear on the next line, as opposed
	  to with a blank line in-between. Complicated sentences,
	  especially those containing quotes, may not be split
	  correctly. This software uses standard techniques for
	  splitting that are correct for many common cases, but in
	  general such splitting is an unsolved problem.</p>
	</div> <!-- alert about approximate text parsing -->
      </dd>
      <dt>Filter Terms</dt>
      <dd>These terms are used to winnow down the 'chunks' or units of
      analysis from above -- only those chunks containing these terms
      will be used.</dd>
      <dt>Analysis Terms</dt>
      <dd>These terms are used to further analyze the filtered
      chunks. The filtered chunks will be grouped based on the
      analysis terms they contain and analyzed separately so that they
      can be compared. For example, you might compare chunks that
      contain 'Trump' versus chunks that contain 'Biden', so see how
      the average sentiment differs, or whether 'Trump' appeared more
      or less often than 'Biden' in Mexican news articles.</dd>
      <dt>Level Filters</dt>
      <dd>If you would like to ONLY include articles from certain
      folders, you can do so here, e.g., by selecting 'Mexico', and
      then 'phase 1' and 'phase 2'.</dd>
      <dt>Number of Clusters</dt>
      <dd>The software will automatically try to clusters the chunks
      using unsupervised machine learning. This setting determines how
      many clusters the software should look for.</dd>
    </dl>
  </p>

  <p>After filling out the settings and clicking "Analyze" you can
  view the results in the other tabs! Large datasets may take several
  seconds to process.</p>
